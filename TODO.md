## Todo List

Jupyter Notebook Examples
  - Plots of C/W/L vectors for different metrics, gain/cost vectors

Tests

Create a check for the AP function
- TREC_EVAL ap score vs CWL_EVAL ap score

- How do we deal with Ties - differences with TREC_EVAL - we dont.

Add in Residuals (ADCS 2015 paper)

Refactor Metrics Class
- make metric_name a function
- change c_vector, w_vector, l_vector, take a Ranking Object, instead of a gain, cost list
